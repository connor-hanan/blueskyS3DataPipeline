# Bluesky Post API

Personal project building a data piple using Bluesky's public API to AWS S3, deployed using Dagster.

As with every new project, we create a virtual enviroment and add the Python version we want to develop with. I'm using Python verson 3.12 for this project

## Python Config

```bash
brew install python@3.12
```

2: **Create a new virtual environment with Python 3.12**:

```bash

```

3: **Activate the new virtual environment**:
